# Tidy_Up_The_Toys PiWars 2021
The object of this challenge is to collect three different coloured
blocks, 50mm x 50mm, red, green and blue and deposit them in a target area.
To gain maximum points, the aim will be to tackle this challenge 
using computer vision with Python OpenCV.
To identify the objects we will be using OpenCV HSV and to calculate the object position, we will be using OpenCV Moments.
